# 100 Days Of Devops - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I created the cloudformation for my new serverless project deploy pipeline, that included codepipeline, and codebuild. This will kick off froma push to my github repo as well

**Thoughts:** I ran into alot of little syntax errors on the cloudformation, and figuring out the code pipeline/build steps. I think that building the frontend will be a challenge for me, now that I got things done in a logical fashion.

**Link to work:**  TBD

### Day 2: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I created the cloudformation for my new serverless projects backend, that included a dynamodb table, cognito pool, iam role, and custom 2 cloudformation functions to do cognito auth domain, and client settings

**Thoughts:** I ran into a few syntax errors on the cloudformation with items in lists today, also hit a wall with cognito not haviing everything fully supported through cloudformaiton, had to find some custom functions online to handle doing a few items. Creating backend compenents for app today was fun.

**Link to work:**  TBD
