# 100 Days Of Devops - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I created the cloudformation for my new serverless project, that included codepipeline, and codebuild. This will kick off froma push to my github repo as well

**Thoughts:** I ran into alot of little syntax errors on the cloudformation, and figuring out the code pipeline/build steps. I think that building the frontend will be a challenge for me, now that I got things done in a logical fashion.

**Link to work:**  TBD

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
